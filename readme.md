Python re-implementations of some grid cell models (under active updating).

Currently implemented models:
- Fuhs, M.C. and Touretzky, D.S., 2006. A spin glass model of path integration in rat medial entorhinal cortex. Journal of Neuroscience, 26(16), pp.4266-4276.
- Burak, Y. and Fiete, I.R., 2009. Accurate path integration in continuous attractor network models of grid cells. PLoS computational biology, 5(2), p.e1000291.

My python re-implementation is heavily based on the matlab implementation by Eric Zilli (https://github.com/ModelDBRepository/144006). Any mistakes are of mine and mine only.
